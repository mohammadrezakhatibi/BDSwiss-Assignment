### Hi 👋🏼

1. There is no necessary setup for running the project. Just clone and run!
2. In the project, there are two small frameworks, APIManager, and Core. Of course, they could be part of the project but I assumed that it can be a bigger project.
3. **The APIManager** is all about networking, it could be more generic and decoupled but I tried to keep everything simple since for a bigger project I will choose a more generic approach.
3. **The Core** framework contains all non-related project functions and helpers, like extensions, etc.
4. I tried to keep everything simple for this simple project and I decided to choose **MVVM** architecture.
5. I tried to use different design patterns in this project like **Adapter, Composite**.
6. You may see no consistency somewhere in my code , it is because I tried to use different approaches to showing my Swift knowledge. for example I've used async/await and completion handler together.
7. I've created a generic list view and it can be used by any pages with that type of UI. it could be more generic but I tried to keep it simple.

**Thank you**
